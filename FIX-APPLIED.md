# Fix Applied: Member Management API Error

## ✅ Problem Fixed

**Error:** `Failed to load company members: Unexpected token '<', "<!DOCTYPE "... is not valid JSON`

**Root Cause:** Frontend was making API requests to `localhost:3000/api/*` (React dev server) instead of `localhost:5000/api/*` (backend server), because no proxy was configured.

## 🔧 Solution Applied

Added proxy configuration to `Frontend/package.json`:

```json
"proxy": "http://localhost:5000"
```

This makes all `/api/*` requests automatically proxy to the backend server.

## 🚀 Next Steps - IMPORTANT!

**You MUST restart the React development server** for the proxy to take effect:

### Windows (Command Prompt or PowerShell):
```bash
# Stop the current server (Ctrl+C in the terminal running it)
cd Frontend
npm start
```

### After Restart:

1. **Clear browser cache** (Ctrl+Shift+Delete) or open in Incognito/Private window
2. **Navigate to:** http://localhost:3000
3. **Login** with a company owner account:
   - `hosterowl@gmail.com` OR
   - `noxtmofficial@gmail.com`
4. **Go to:** Dashboard → Workspace Settings → **Members** tab
5. **You should now see:**
   - ✅ Company members loading successfully
   - ✅ "Invite Members" button visible
   - ✅ No JSON parse errors

## 🧪 Testing the Full Flow

### 1. View Members
- Login as company owner
- Navigate to Members tab
- See list of current members

### 2. Generate Invite Link
- Click "Invite Members" button
- Enter email: `newmember@example.com`
- Select role: Member or Admin
- Click "Generate Invite Link"
- Copy the generated URL

### 3. Accept Invitation
- Logout or use incognito window
- Visit the invite link
- If logged in: Click "Accept Invitation"
- If not logged in: Click "Create New Account" or login

### 4. Verify Member Added
- Login as company owner again
- Go to Members tab
- See the new member in the list

## 📝 Technical Details

### What Changed:
- `Frontend/package.json` - Added `"proxy": "http://localhost:5000"`

### How It Works:
When the React dev server receives a request to `/api/*`, it automatically forwards it to `http://localhost:5000/api/*` (the backend).

### Files That Use This:
- `WorkspaceSettings.js` - Fetches company members and details
- All other components using `/api/*` endpoints

## ⚠️ Production Note

In production, this proxy is not needed because:
1. Both frontend and backend are served from the same domain
2. The backend serves the built React app as static files
3. API routes are handled by the same Express server

## 🎯 Expected Behavior After Fix

### Members Tab:
```
👥 Company Members
Hosterowl • 2 members

[Invite Members] (button visible to Owner/Admin)

┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ HO  hosterowl               Owner  Active  │
│     hosterowl@gmail.com                   │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ HO  hosteroil               Member Active │
│     hosterroil10@gmail.com                │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Console Logs (F12):
```
Fetching company members...
Response status: 200
Response data: {success: true, members: Array(2), total: 2, ...}
Loaded members: 2
Fetching company details...
Company details response: {success: true, company: {...}}
Company details loaded: {companyName: "Hosterowl", ...}
```

## ✅ Verification Checklist

- [ ] React dev server restarted
- [ ] Browser cache cleared or using incognito
- [ ] Logged in as company owner
- [ ] Members tab shows company members
- [ ] "Invite Members" button is visible
- [ ] No JSON parse errors in console
- [ ] Can generate invite links
- [ ] Can copy invite link to clipboard
- [ ] Invite link acceptance works

## 🆘 If Still Not Working

1. **Check both servers are running:**
   ```bash
   # Backend should be on port 5000
   # Frontend should be on port 3000
   ```

2. **Check browser console (F12) for errors**

3. **Verify proxy is active:**
   - Open browser Network tab (F12 → Network)
   - Go to Members tab
   - Look for request to `/api/company/members`
   - Check "Remote Address" - should show `localhost:5000`

4. **Try hard refresh:** Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)

---

**The fix is now complete! Restart your React dev server and test it out.**
