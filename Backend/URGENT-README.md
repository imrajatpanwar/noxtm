# üö® URGENT: EMAIL SECURITY ISSUE - ACTION REQUIRED

## What Happened?

Your hosting provider warned you about **excessive SMTP traffic on port 25** from server **185.137.122.61**. This indicates either:
1. Your server is compromised and sending spam
2. Your application has a bug causing email loops
3. Someone is abusing your email endpoints

## What We Fixed

‚úÖ **Added Rate Limiting** - Prevents abuse by limiting email sends
‚úÖ **Added Email Validation** - Blocks invalid/disposable email addresses
‚úÖ **Added Email Logging** - All emails are logged to MongoDB
‚úÖ **Created Diagnostic Tools** - Scripts to check server security

## ‚ö° WHAT YOU NEED TO DO NOW (5 Steps)

### Step 1: Check if Your Server is Compromised (5 minutes)

**On Windows:**
```powershell
cd c:\exe\noxtm\Backend\scripts
.\check-mail-server-security.ps1
```

Follow the instructions to SSH into your server and run diagnostic commands.

**OR upload the bash script:**
```bash
# From Windows Command Prompt or PowerShell
scp "c:\exe\noxtm\Backend\scripts\check-mail-server-security.sh" root@185.137.122.61:/root/

# SSH to server
ssh root@185.137.122.61

# Run diagnostic
chmod +x /root/check-mail-server-security.sh
sudo /root/check-mail-server-security.sh
```

### Step 2: If Server is Compromised - STOP THE BLEEDING

If the diagnostic shows:
- More than 10 active SMTP connections
- More than 100 emails in queue
- Open relay configuration
- Suspicious processes

**Immediately run on your server:**
```bash
# Stop email service
sudo systemctl stop postfix

# Delete all queued emails
sudo postsuper -d ALL

# Block outgoing port 25
sudo iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp --dport 25 -j DROP
```

### Step 3: Switch to Secure SMTP (15 minutes)

**WE STRONGLY RECOMMEND: Use External SMTP Service (Mailgun)**

#### Why external SMTP?
- ‚úÖ No more security issues
- ‚úÖ Better email deliverability
- ‚úÖ No maintenance required
- ‚úÖ FREE tier: 5,000 emails/month

#### Quick Setup (Mailgun):

1. **Sign up:** https://www.mailgun.com (use your noxtm.com email)

2. **Add domain:**
   - Go to Sending ‚Üí Domains ‚Üí Add New Domain
   - Enter: `noxtm.com`

3. **Add DNS records** (in your domain provider):
   - Copy the TXT and CNAME records from Mailgun
   - Add them to your DNS (usually takes 5-30 minutes to propagate)

4. **Get SMTP credentials:**
   - Go to: Sending ‚Üí Domain settings ‚Üí SMTP credentials
   - Click "Reset password" to generate new password
   - Copy username: `postmaster@mg.noxtm.com`
   - Copy password

5. **Update `.env` file:**

Open `c:\exe\noxtm\Backend\.env` and change:

**FROM (INSECURE):**
```env
EMAIL_HOST=185.137.122.61
EMAIL_PORT=25
EMAIL_USER=
EMAIL_PASS=
EMAIL_FROM=noreply@noxtm.com
```

**TO (SECURE):**
```env
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.mailgun.org
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USER=postmaster@mg.noxtm.com
EMAIL_PASS=<paste-mailgun-password-here>
EMAIL_FROM=noreply@noxtm.com
```

### Step 4: Restart Backend & Test (2 minutes)

```bash
# Stop backend
# Press Ctrl+C if running in terminal

# Start backend
cd c:\exe\noxtm\Backend
npm start

# In a new terminal, test email:
node test-email.js your-email@example.com
```

You should receive a test email within seconds!

### Step 5: Reply to Hosting Provider (2 minutes)

Send them this message:

```
Subject: Re: High SMTP Traffic Alert - Issue Resolved

Dear Support Team,

Thank you for alerting us about the unusual SMTP traffic on server 185.137.122.61.

We have completed a full security audit and taken corrective actions:

ACTIONS TAKEN:
‚úÖ Migrated to Mailgun external SMTP service (no longer using port 25)
‚úÖ Implemented rate limiting (3 emails/hour max for signup/reset)
‚úÖ Added email validation to block disposable domains
‚úÖ Enabled comprehensive email logging
‚úÖ Blocked outbound port 25 at firewall level
‚úÖ Flushed mail queue and stopped Postfix service

EXPECTED EMAIL VOLUME:
- Average: 20-50 emails/day
- Peak: up to 100 emails/day
- Types: User signup verifications, password resets, team invitations

MONITORING:
We now log all outbound emails to database and have alerts for unusual activity.

Port 25 is no longer needed or used. All email now goes through Mailgun's authenticated SMTP on port 587.

Please confirm we're in good standing and no restrictions are in place.

Thank you for your patience.

Best regards,
Rajat
Noxtm Studio Team
```

## üìö Detailed Documentation

For complete documentation and alternative SMTP options, see:
- **[EMAIL-SECURITY-FIX.md](./EMAIL-SECURITY-FIX.md)** - Complete guide with all options
- **[check-mail-server-security.sh](./scripts/check-mail-server-security.sh)** - Server diagnostic script
- **[test-email-security.js](./scripts/test-email-security.js)** - Test rate limiting & validation

## üîç Monitoring Going Forward

### Check Email Logs in MongoDB

```javascript
// Connect to MongoDB
mongo "your-mongodb-uri"

// View recent emails
db.emaillogs.find().sort({sentAt: -1}).limit(20)

// Check for failures
db.emaillogs.find({status: "failed"})

// Check volume (last hour)
db.emaillogs.countDocuments({
  sentAt: {$gte: new Date(Date.now() - 3600000)}
})
```

### Check Rate Limiting Works

Try signing up with the same email 4 times quickly - the 4th request should fail with:
```json
{
  "message": "Too many verification code requests. Please try again in 1 hour.",
  "error": "RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED"
}
```

---

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

### Email test fails with "Connection refused"
- Check EMAIL_HOST is correct in .env
- Check EMAIL_PORT (should be 587 for external SMTP)
- Verify Mailgun/SendGrid credentials

### Email test fails with "Authentication failed"
- Double-check EMAIL_USER and EMAIL_PASS
- Make sure you copied the correct password from Mailgun
- Try resetting the SMTP password in Mailgun dashboard

### "Database unavailable" error
- Check MONGODB_URI in .env
- Verify MongoDB Atlas cluster is running
- Check network access whitelist in MongoDB Atlas

### Server still shows high SMTP traffic
- Make sure Postfix is stopped: `sudo systemctl status postfix`
- Check queue is empty: `mailq` (should show "Mail queue is empty")
- Verify firewall rule: `sudo iptables -L | grep 25`

## üìû Need Help?

1. **Check the logs:**
   ```bash
   # Backend logs
   tail -f c:\exe\noxtm\Backend\server.log

   # On server (if using own mail server)
   ssh root@185.137.122.61
   tail -f /var/log/mail.log
   ```

2. **Test SMTP connection:**
   ```bash
   # Test Mailgun
   telnet smtp.mailgun.org 587

   # Should see: "220 Mailgun Influx ready"
   # Press Ctrl+] then type "quit"
   ```

3. **Verify DNS records** (if using Mailgun):
   ```bash
   # Check SPF record
   nslookup -type=TXT noxtm.com

   # Check DKIM
   nslookup -type=TXT mg._domainkey.noxtm.com
   ```
