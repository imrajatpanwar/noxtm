# Chrome Extension Integration Guide

## Issue Resolution: "Unchecked runtime.lastError" Error

This document explains how we fixed the "Unchecked runtime.lastError: The message port closed before a response was received" error that appeared in the dashboard.

### What Caused the Error

The error occurs when:
1. Code attempts to communicate with a Chrome extension using `chrome.runtime.sendMessage`
2. The extension is not available, not installed, or fails to respond
3. The code does not properly check for `chrome.runtime.lastError` in the callback

This is a common issue when websites try to integrate with Chrome extensions but don't handle the case where the extension might not be present.

### Our Solution

We've implemented a robust extension messaging system with these components:

1. **Extension Helpers** (`utils/extensionHelpers.js`):
   - `sendExtensionMessage`: A safe wrapper around `chrome.runtime.sendMessage` that properly checks for `lastError`
   - `addExtensionListener`: Handles incoming extension messages safely
   - `isExtensionConnected`: Checks if an extension is available and connected

2. **Extension Manager** (`utils/extensionManager.js`):
   - Initializes extension connectivity early in app lifecycle
   - Provides connection state tracking and notification
   - Manages reconnection and disconnection events

3. **Dashboard Component** update:
   - Uses the helper functions instead of direct Chrome API calls
   - Falls back gracefully to API calls when the extension is unavailable
   - Properly handles the error state

### How to Use the Extension Integration

#### Sending Messages to the Extension

Instead of directly using `chrome.runtime.sendMessage`, use our helper:

```javascript
import { sendExtensionMessage } from '../utils/extensionHelpers';

// Later in your code:
try {
  const response = await sendExtensionMessage({ 
    type: 'someAction',
    data: { /* any data */ } 
  });
  
  // Handle response
  console.log('Got response:', response);
} catch (error) {
  // Handle errors (including extension unavailable)
  console.warn('Extension communication failed:', error);
}
```

#### Listening for Extension Messages

To listen for messages from the extension:

```javascript
import { addExtensionListener } from '../utils/extensionHelpers';

// Set up a listener (returns a function to remove the listener)
const removeListener = addExtensionListener((message, sender) => {
  console.log('Received from extension:', message);
  
  if (message.type === 'dataUpdate') {
    // Handle data update
    return { received: true }; // Optional response
  }
  
  // Return a response if needed (can be async)
  return { status: 'ok' };
});

// When you want to stop listening
removeListener();
```

#### Checking Extension Connection

To check if the extension is connected:

```javascript
import { checkExtensionConnection } from '../utils/extensionManager';

async function someFunction() {
  const isConnected = await checkExtensionConnection();
  
  if (isConnected) {
    // Use extension functionality
  } else {
    // Fall back to alternative approach
  }
}
```

### Best Practices

1. **Always handle disconnection**: Provide fallbacks for when the extension is not available.
2. **Avoid blocking UI**: Don't make the application dependent on extension responses.
3. **Error boundaries**: Wrap extension communication in try/catch blocks.
4. **Timeouts**: Set appropriate timeouts for extension operations to prevent hanging UI.

With these changes, your application should now be resilient to extension availability issues and will no longer show the "Unchecked runtime.lastError" warning in the console.
